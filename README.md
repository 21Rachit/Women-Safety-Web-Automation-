# Women-Safety-Web-Automation
Scenario:

Suppose a  lady is going back home late at night after completing her office routine. And suddenly a stranger starts following her
Now the girl knows that if she takes out her phone , the stranger may attack her or involve in some unwanted activity with her.
So what can she do??

Analysis of scenario:

It is obvious that she must be thinking of lots of possible solutions to escape from this situation like sending her locations to her parents
or relatives and call for help or searching for the nearest police station.But she knows if she takes out her phone to do these things, her life
may be in danger.

Solution:

Here Web automation is the perfect solution for this scenario.For example what solutions she might be thinking of, can be automated with help 
of automation software
So here I have used Uipath software. All the possible solutions like sending detailed location details to relatives and parents, searching for the nearest police 
station etc. have been very sequentially deployed in the above (ReallyFinalHackathonProject1.xaml) file.

Vedio:

All the steps shown in the vedio is automated by the software and no human intervention is involved.
